--The Produce a list of costly bookings exercise contained some messy logic: we had to calculate the booking cost in both

--Remember that guests have different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and the guest user is

--############ MODIFYING DATA ############

--In the previous exercise, you learned how to add a facility. Now you're going to add multiple facilities in one command. 
--Use the following values:

(10, 'Squash Court 2', 3.5, 17.5, 5000, 80);

--Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for 
--the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else:
--Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)

--We want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without 
--using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.
